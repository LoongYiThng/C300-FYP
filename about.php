            <h1>Purpose</h1>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">To automate data sanitizing through the use of scripts or web application</h2>
        </div>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            it starts with you, the user of the application uploading a document to the website to out the website. currently 
            we support word files text files and typing arbitrary text. once that is done all you need to do is choose one or 
            more sanitization techniques. finally, select submit and your file will be submitted to our servers for processing.
            once sanitized, the file will be available for download. however please remember to check that your file is
            legitimate and genuine by comparing the downloaded files SSH value with the SSH value generated.
        </p>
